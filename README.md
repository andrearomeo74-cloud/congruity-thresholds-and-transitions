# Congruity Thresholds & Transitions

### A grammar of admissible phase transitions

This repository formalizes a missing structural layer of the Congruity framework:

> Congruity is not about stable states.  
> It is about which transitions a system can cross without structural collapse.

While other repositories describe *levels of congruity*, this work focuses on:
- thresholds
- admissible vs non-admissible transitions
- congruity debt and delayed collapse
- phase exclusion and irreversibility

Congruity does not predict outcomes.  
It constrains paths.

## Core Claim

Most failures in biological, cognitive, organizational, and artificial systems
do not occur *within* a level —  
they occur during **non-admissible transitions between levels**.

## Repository Structure

- **01** – Congruity as a grammar of transitions  
- **02** – Thresholds and congruity debt  
- **03** – Phase collapse and exclusion  
- **04** – Cross-domain examples  
- **05** – Limits of optimization

## Relation to Other Repositories

This repository complements:

- *DNA as Structural Congruity Memory*
- *Congruity and Aging*
- *Congruity-safe AI*

DNA encodes *what survived*.  
This repository explains *why some transitions never survive*.

## Status

Conceptual and structural.  
No mathematics required.  
No optimization proposed.

Read as grammar, not theory.
