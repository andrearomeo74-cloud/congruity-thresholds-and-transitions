# Early Signals and Transition Indicators

### How systems announce loss of congruity before collapse

---

## 1. Transitions Are Not Instantaneous

In congruity theory, transitions do not occur as abrupt jumps.
They are preceded by detectable structural signals.

What appears externally as a “sudden failure” is, internally,
the end of a long process of admissibility erosion.

Congruity fails *before* collapse becomes visible.

---

## 2. Early Signals vs Outcomes

Traditional models focus on outcomes:
- crashes
- breakdowns
- disease onset
- systemic failure

Congruity focuses on **precursors**.

Early signals are not events.
They are **structural warnings** that the system is approaching
a boundary of admissibility.

---

## 3. Canonical Early Indicators of Incongruity

Across biological, cognitive, economic, and physical systems,
the same indicators recur:

### 3.1 Increased Energy Cost per Unit Outcome
The system expends more energy to maintain the same function.

Examples:
- metabolic inefficiency
- economic debt acceleration
- cognitive fatigue
- algorithmic overfitting cost

---

### 3.2 Temporal Compression

Processes that once unfolded smoothly begin to:
- accelerate abnormally
- cluster in time
- lose buffering intervals

This creates urgency without progress.

---

### 3.3 Loss of Reversibility

Small perturbations no longer self-correct.
Recovery requires external intervention.

This is the hallmark of nearing a threshold.

---

### 3.4 Local Optimization at the Expense of Global Coherence

Subsystems optimize internally while degrading the whole.

This produces:
- silo behavior
- pathological specialization
- brittle efficiency

---

### 3.5 Increase in Noise Without Information Gain

Variability increases, but meaning does not.
Signal-to-noise ratio collapses.

This is often misread as “complexity”.
It is not complexity — it is incoherence.

---

## 4. Phase Drift and Directional Bias

Before a transition, systems exhibit **directional bias**:
they drift toward certain phase-classes and cannot access others.

This creates:
- behavioral rigidity
- decision lock-in
- reduced option space

The system still moves — but only in fewer directions.

---

## 5. Threshold Crossing as a Point of No Return

A transition threshold is crossed when:
- recovery energy exceeds system capacity
- coherence cannot be re-established internally

Beyond this point, restoration requires **restructuring**, not repair.

Congruity theory distinguishes clearly between:
- repairable deviation
- irreversible transition

---

## 6. Why Early Detection Matters

Early signals are the last point at which:
- intervention is cheap
- change is proportional
- damage is minimal

After threshold crossing:
- costs explode
- freedom collapses
- options vanish

Congruity is therefore an **early-warning grammar**, not a post-mortem tool.

---

## 7. Transition Indicators as a Universal Layer

These indicators are domain-independent.

They apply to:
- organisms
- economies
- infrastructures
- AI systems
- social structures
- planetary systems

Different surfaces.
Same grammar.

---

## 8. Summary

- Systems announce loss of congruity before failure.
- These announcements follow repeatable structural patterns.
- Congruity provides a language to read them.
- Thresholds are not guesses — they are crossings.

What collapses last is structure.
What fails first is congruity.

The signal always comes before the break.
